                <p>The Vanderbilt Center for Child Development will be able to test your child for significant delays while also eliminating other options by genetic testing. The current wait list time is anywhere from 3 to 12 months. It is advised to connect with them as quickly as possible if you suspect your child is atypical.</p>

                        <p>This includes the child attending a typical classroom and they are provided one aid to be shared between many children.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>One-on-one aid</h4>
                        <p>This is the ideal option but it is a very limited resource. You have to prove your child needs the most help out of all the other students eligible for one on one aid.</p>

                        <p>The CDC meets a huge range of needs. However, the students greatly outnumber the head teacher and the several assistants</p>

            <h4>Extra Resource Classroom</h4>
            <p>The ERC provided a middle ground for students. They were able to attend  typical classes that benefitted them. They would then go to the ERC to work with aids in areas of academics they struggled with. The ERC was disbanded  in 2009. Talk with your local advocate and fight to bring the ERC back to Middle TN.</p>
